# Workspace Sharing User Guide

## Overview

The workspace sharing feature in Noded allows you to collaborate with others by sharing your workspaces. You can share workspaces directly with specific users or create shareable links for broader access. All shared workspaces are viewed in read-only mode to protect your original work.

## Security and Privacy

### Your Data is Protected
- Shared workspaces are always read-only
- Original workspace remains unchanged
- Share recipients cannot modify your work
- You control who has access at all times

### Best Practices
1. **Be selective** with direct shares - only share with trusted users
2. **Use expiring links** for temporary access
3. **Require login** for sensitive workspaces
4. **Review active shares** regularly
5. **Revoke access** when collaboration ends

### Privacy Considerations
- Usernames are visible to share recipients
- Share activity is logged for security
- Deleted workspaces automatically revoke all shares

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"User not found" when sharing**
- Verify the exact username spelling
- The user must have a Noded account
